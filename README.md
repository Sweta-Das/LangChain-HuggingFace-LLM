# LangChain
- an open-source framework designed to streamline the development of apps leveraging LLMs
- acts as a toolbox that simplifies incorporating LLMs into various applications
- Key Features:
    - **Modular Components**:
        - LangChain offers a collection of reusable building blocks, like functions & classes, representing common tasks encountered when working with LLMs
        - easily combined to construct complex applications
        - makes development faster & less error-prone
    - **Focus on Reusability**:
        - Promotes code reusability by providing standardized interfaces for various functionalities
        - Allows developers to create easily integratable components
    - **Data Augmented Generation**:
        - Allows incorporation of external data sources into the LLM generation process
        - Useful for Q&A and summarizers, where LLM can access & leverage relevant info from outside sources to enhance its responses
    - **Agent Design**:
        - Provides tools to design intelligent agents that interacts with environment & make decisions based on LLM outputs
        - These agents can be programmed to take actions, receive observations from the environment, and use this information to iteratively perform tasks.
    - **Memory Management**: 
        - Incorporates mechanisms to remember information across LLM interactions
